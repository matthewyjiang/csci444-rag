            EXPECTED:  true
            RESPONSE: "True. According to the text, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is considered a non-parametric method because it does not learn parameters that are fixed regardless of the training dataset size. Instead, the algorithm requires test data and its performance relies on the similarity between the new input and the training examples."

            RESPONSE: "The learning rate is not mentioned as a specific parameter in the given context. However, it can be inferred that the learning rate (or learning step size) affects how quickly the algorithm collects data and learns from experience.

In Q-learning, for example, the update rule involves adding a fixed increment to the estimated Q-value based on the observed reward and Q-value difference. The magnitude of this increment is determined by the learning rate (usually denoted as α).

A high learning rate would result in faster convergence but might also lead to oscillations or overestimation of Q-values, while a low learning rate would result in slower convergence but potentially more accurate estimates.

In reinforcement learning, the learning rate represents how much influence the algorithm has on collecting data and making decisions."

            QUESTION: What does softmax regression generalize?
            EXPECTED: Logistic regression to multi-class classification.
            RESPONSE: "Softmax regression generalizes logistic regression to multi-class classification problems by extending it from binary classes (e.g., 0/1) to C classes, where each class has its own parameter vector. It predicts a probability distribution over all possible classes for a given input."

            EXPECTED: The hyperplane where w * x + b = 0.
            RESPONSE: "The decision boundary in logistic regression is defined by the equation w⊤x + b = 0, where w and b are parameters of the model, and x is the feature vector. This hyperplane is always perpendicular to the weight vector w."

            QUESTION: What is the main difference between generative and discriminative classifiers?
            EXPECTED: Generative classifiers model P(x, y), while discriminative classifiers model P(y | x).
            RESPONSE: "The main difference between generative and discriminative classifiers is their approach:

* Generative classifiers model the joint process of generating both inputs (x) and outputs (y), allowing for Bayes' Rule to compute p(y | x).
* Discriminative classifiers only model the conditional probability of y given x, without assuming any relationship between x and y."

            RESPONSE: "A multivariate Gaussian distribution, also known as a joint normal distribution, is a probability distribution where each dimension of the random vector is normally distributed. It's parameterized by a mean vector (µ) and a covariance matrix (Σ), which controls the shape and spread of the distribution in multiple dimensions."

            RESPONSE: "The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a general technique used to both learn unknown parameters of a probability distribution and perform inference on latent variables by alternating between two steps:

1. E-step: Infer latent variable's distributions given current guess of parameters.
2. M-step: Choose value of parameters that best fit the data based on the current inferred distribution of latent variables."
